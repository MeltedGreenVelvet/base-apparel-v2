## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

### Additional features

- CSS transition animations between hover states
- Receive a success message when the 'form' is submitted with a valid email address.
- Logo made into clickable link (back to a theoretical website home page)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS Animation
- SCSS/SASS
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

This is the first project where I utilized Figma's new Dev Mode! I still want to tinker with it, but I did find it useful to work with during this project.

### Continued development

I would like to continue building upon my animation skills, both in CSS and in Javascript.

Ctrl + V of first project's acknowledgements and utilized resources:

- https://stackoverflow.com/ - Of course, always a great addition in a dev's resource section. I feel that Stack Overflow is the very first website I go to whenever a piece of code is breaking, and I can't figure out why.
- https://www.w3schools.com/ - I regularly use this website to check my code's syntax. I can learn a concept quickly, but syntax is something that is acquired with usage and experience. Besides playing creating with code, W3 Schools is great for helping me through that process.
- https://scrimba.com/ - A great partner to Frontend Mentor. I've been enjoying using both websites to advance my knowledge and refresh rusty skills.
- https://www.youtube.com/ - An obvious one, but I had to peruse several videos for the custom JS form validation.
- https://codepen.io/ - Such a fun and explorative website, great for playing around with others' code that is both unfamiliar and very pretty.
- I heavily referenced a JavaScript Academy pen, as well as watched this developer's accompanying YouTube video. I coded along to his video, practiced with a separate repo, and eventually utilized his solution in this challenge. Both the pen and video are linked below.
